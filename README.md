confpapersplit
==============

Let's split some conference papers in half so we can read them on
smaller devices in continuous scroll mode instead of fumbling around on
the screen like idiots.

Usage
-----

To split a file './paper.pdf':

    python2 confpapersplit.py ./paper.pdf

That's it. Your split pdf will be located at './paper-split.pdf'
